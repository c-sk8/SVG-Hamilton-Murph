# SVG Hamilton Murph

This clock design is based on the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph watch. If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches and the designs they use.

This project uses hand crafted SVG files, and is made into a working clock using Javascript, CSS, and HTML.

The initial size of this watch is fairly small which fits well onto a small display like that of an iPhone, but you can zooming in
using your browser to make the watch bigger. Because it is made with SVG the shapes will always have sharp edges.

I have only tested this using my MacBook, iPhone, and the Safari browser, so I don't know if it will work on other browsers.
I have avoided using special effects like shadows and bluring which the browser stuggles with.
