# SVG Hamilton Murph

This analogue clock is based on the Hamilton Khaki Field Murph watch. If I am breaking any copyright rules by copying the design of this watch then I am happy to remove this project, but I am a big fan Hamilton watches and the designs they use.

This project uses hand crafted **SVG** files, and is made into a working clock using **Javascript**, **CSS**, and **HTML**.

The initial size of this watch is fairly small which fits well onto a small display like that of an iPhone, but you can **zoom in
using your browser** to make the watch bigger. Because it is made with SVG the shapes will always have sharp edges.

I have only tested this using my MacBook, and iPhone, using the Safari browser.
I have avoided using special effects like shadows and bluring which browsers stuggle with.
